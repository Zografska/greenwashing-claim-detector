# ECGT gold set — 100 Carrefour Italy products

Gold evaluation set for a detector of claims under the EU ECGT rules (Directive 2024/825), built from `clean/carrefour.json`. Every claim is copied verbatim from the source `description`, and each label is derived mechanically from its triggers (only out_of_scope → DISCARDED; any group-A trigger → IN_SCOPE; otherwise group B → NEEDS_VERIFICATION; defined_term cancels undefined_natural). Existing annotation fields: none were present in this file, so nothing could have been copied.

Files: `golden_set_ecgt_100.json` (the 100 selected products), `golden_set_ecgt_reserve.json` (the other 174 usable products, labelled the same way), and this README.

## Pool size

The brief expected a pool of 150 records. `clean/carrefour.json` actually holds **300** records, so the accounting below is: 100 selected + 174 reserve + 26 unusable = 300.

## Field mapping (Carrefour)

| Output field | Source |
|---|---|
| product_id | `product_id` |
| ean | `ean` |
| name | `name` |
| category | `origin_file` (Carrefour aisle slug) |
| source_file | constant `clean/carrefour.json` |
| source_index | position in the JSON array |
| retailer | constant `Carrefour` |
| brand | derived from `name` and text (Carrefour private lines kept as written, e.g. "Carrefour Bio", "Simpl"; Milk / Milk Pro / Brescia merged as "Centrale del Latte di Brescia") |
| claims[].source_field | always `description`: the only text field. Carrefour folds features, producer info, certifications and lifestyle badges into it. |
| url | not used |

The file has no separate `recycling` field. Carrefour appends a packaging-disposal block to `description`, with lines such as «Bottiglia Plastica - Largamente riciclabile», «Confezione - PAP 21 - Raccolta carta» and «Verifica le disposizioni del tuo Comune». That block is treated as the `recycling` field and never extracted. Structured lines starting «Origine Altro Testo …» or «Luogo di provenienza …» are the retailer's origin fields, so they are not extracted either. The label «Metodo di Pesca» is dropped in front of fishing-method text. The product object also carries a product-level `triggers` list (the union of its claims' triggers), as the brief asked. The claim-level gray zone is recorded at the start of `note` («Gray zone: …»).

## Unusable records

26 records were set aside. Duplicates: none. All 300 EANs are unique and there is no repeated brand + name.

No product was relabelled to fit a quota.

## Selection method

`random.seed(42)`, then a greedy pass:

1. Triggers, rarest first: add products carrying the trigger until it appears in 3 selected products.
2. Gray zones, rarest first: at least 3 products tagged with each.
3. hard_no products that have DISCARDED decoys, up to 24.
4. Fill in_between, then hard_yes, then hard_no, up to their targets.

Each step picks the highest-scoring candidate within the per-brand cap and the bucket targets. The score rewards triggers still under 3, personal care / household products while that group is under 25, IN_SCOPE / NEEDS_VERIFICATION / DISCARDED claim mix, and decoys in hard_no. It penalises brands already selected. Random numbers break ties.

## Bucket rules as applied

- **hard_yes**: at least one IN_SCOPE or NEEDS_VERIFICATION claim, and none of those claims sits on a gray zone.
- **in_between**: at least one IN_SCOPE or NEEDS_VERIFICATION claim sits on a gray zone. The product `gray_zone` is that claim's zone; if there are several, the rarest zone is used.
- **hard_no**: no IN_SCOPE or NEEDS_VERIFICATION claim. Some hard_no products carry a `gray_zone` because a DISCARDED claim sits on one, e.g. risk_vs_performance. These are deliberate decoys, and they stay hard_no because the validation rule forbids positive claims in hard_no.

## Judgment calls (every low-confidence claim)

General conventions, applied across the whole pool:
- Renewable-energy claims («100% energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili») → generic_green (low). No trigger names them, and the closest rule treats them as unsubstantiated environmental benefit claims.
- Bio-based / plant-sourced packaging → recycled_recyclable or certification (low). There is no bio-based trigger.
- Recycling calls-to-action («Riciclami!», «Ricicliamo insieme», «Rispetta l'ambiente» before the disposal block) are not extracted. First-person statements («Rispettiamo l'ambiente», «X per l'ambiente») are extracted.
- «naturalmente privo di lattosio» / «naturalmente ricco di fibre» → out_of_scope, as the natural-absence idiom. «lattice di gomma naturale» → out_of_scope, as a material name.
- Sales denominations that contain «bio» are not extracted (review removed 4 that had slipped in).
- «Benessere animale garantito» with no named scheme → vague_supply_chain.

## Validation

`validate.py` output (final run):

```
selected 100 reserve 174 unusable 26 total 300 of 300
claims checked 1475
buckets {'hard_yes': 35, 'hard_no': 30, 'in_between': 35}
max per brand ("L'Angelica", 2)
retailer share {'Carrefour': 1.0} (cap 40% NOT MET: single-retailer pool)
FAILURES: 0
```

Checks: exactly 100 selected; selected + reserve + unusable = 300; every claim_text (each part around " ... ") and every footnote is an exact substring of the source description; every label equals the label derived from its triggers; bucket consistency; no duplicate EAN or brand + name; brand cap respected. A second reviewer checked the 100 selected products and flagged 8 missed claims, 18 claims that should not have been extracted, 0 trigger errors and 0 boundary errors.

- **Fixed:** 7 missed claims were added. 16 structured origin/provenance lines and sales-name lines were removed, and the same rule was then applied across the whole pool: 3 more sales-name «bio» lines came out of the reserve.
- **Kept on purpose:** «Rispetta l'ambiente» (idx 110) stays out, as a recycling call-to-action placed just before the disposal block. The standalone badges «Biologico» (idx 167) and «Senza lieviti» (idx 281) stay in, because they are badges rather than sales names.
- **Reserve:** the 174 reserve products did not get this second review.
